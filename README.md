# AppEaser
Public repository for AppEaser for Revit by SPECtrumBIM
This is a simple app that is designed to ease the pain of managing Revit addins, apps, and extensions.  It is a standalone windows app that reads installed Revit versions and apps and allows you to select which are enabled.  Once selected it allows you to launch your desired version of Revit with only the desired apps enabled.
